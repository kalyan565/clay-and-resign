# Logo Setup Instructions

## How to Add Your Logo

1. **Save your logo image** (the VS3 Clay and Resin Art Studio logo from the image you provided)
   - Remove the white background (make it transparent)
   - Save it as a PNG file with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (square format)

2. **Place the logo file** in the `public` folder:
   - File name: `logo.png`
   - Full path: `public/logo.png`

3. **Alternative formats**: If you have the logo in a different format:
   - PNG with transparency (recommended)
   - SVG (best for scaling)
   - If using SVG, update `Logo.tsx` to use `.svg` extension

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (or SVG)
- **Size**: Minimum 200x200px, recommended 400x400px or larger
- **Background**: Must be transparent (no white background)
